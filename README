Task Manager
============

Mike Perron (2013)

This is a Kraknet module. In order to use this you need to:
	-	Clone into your mods/ directory
	-	Run `make` in taskmanager/src/
	-	Symlink taskmanager/web/ in your web/.
			(e.g.: you@host:web/$ ln -s -T ../mods/taskmanager/web taskmanager)

Most of the tool is comprised of a couple of bash scripts, with the decoding of
URI-encoded strings performed by a small C program for speed.
